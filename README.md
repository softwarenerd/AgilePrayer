## The Scrum Master's Prayer

Our Agile Father who art in Sprint Planning,  
hallowed be thy process.  
Thy checkins come.  
Thy merge be done on remote as it is in local.  
Give us this day our daily stand up,  
and forgive us our merge conflicts,  
as we forgive those with merge conflicts against us,  
and lead us not into waterfall, but deliver us from sprint review.
